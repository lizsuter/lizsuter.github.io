## Welcome to My Practice Website for FOSS 2020

*I made this website using this [theme](https://academicpages.github.io/). Please check out the rest of my site*

***
I use github to to post some tutorials for my students in R markdown. For example:  
[Tutorial 1](https://lizsuter.github.io/files/PRJNA421986_PacificOyster_Dada2_postanalysis.html)  
[Tutorial 2](https://lizsuter.github.io/files/PRJNA421986_PacificOyster_QIIME2_postanalysis.html)


***
For the FOSS Week 1 homework, I decided to expand on this [repo](https://github.com/lizsuter/MarineAnimalDisease) with materials for a resaerch project on tracking Marine Animal Diseases using microbiome datasets.

My goal is to have students clone the repo, then follow along with the instructions in the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/lizsuter/MarineAnimalDisease/wiki), while checking them off on the associated [Project Board](https://github.com/lizsuter/MarineAnimalDisease/projects/1).
