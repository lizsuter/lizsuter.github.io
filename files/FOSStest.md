## Welcome to My Practice Website for FOSS 2020

*I made this website using this [theme](https://academicpages.github.io/). Please check out the rest of my site*

I use github to to post some tutorials for my students in R markdown. For example:  
[Tutorial 1](https://lizsuter.github.io/files/PRJNA421986_PacificOyster_Dada2_postanalysis.html)  
[Tutorial 2](https://lizsuter.github.io/files/PRJNA421986_PacificOyster_QIIME2_postanalysis.html)

So for the FOSS Week 1 homework, I decided to make a [Github Wiki](https://github.com/lizsuter/MarineAnimalDisease/wiki) and associated [Project Board](https://github.com/lizsuter/MarineAnimalDisease/projects/1) for this [resaerch project](https://github.com/lizsuter/MarineAnimalDisease) on tracking Marine Animal Diseases using microbiome datasets. My goal is to have students clone the repo, then follow along with the instructions in the Wiki, while checking them off in the Project Board.
