## Welcome to My Practice Website for FOSS 2020

I made this website using this [theme](https://academicpages.github.io/). Please check out the rest of my site :grin: .

I also use this space to post some tutorials for my students in R markdown. For example:  
[Tutorial 1](https://lizsuter.github.io/files/PRJNA421986_PacificOyster_Dada2_postanalysis.html)  
[Tutorial 2](https://lizsuter.github.io/files/PRJNA421986_PacificOyster_QIIME2_postanalysis.html)


### Here's some Markdown

```markdown
