## Welcome to My Practice Website for FOSS 2020

*I made this website using this [theme](https://academicpages.github.io/). Please check out the rest of my site*

***
I use github to to post some tutorials for my students in R markdown. For example:  
[Tutorial 1](https://lizsuter.github.io/files/PRJNA421986_PacificOyster_Dada2_postanalysis.html)  
[Tutorial 2](https://lizsuter.github.io/files/PRJNA421986_PacificOyster_QIIME2_postanalysis.html)


***
For the FOSS Week 1 homework, I decided to expand on this [repo](https://github.com/lizsuter/MarineAnimalDisease), a research project about tracking Marine Animal Diseases using microbiome datasets. Each student works on a different dataset while using the same general steps.

My goal is to have students clone the repo, which has important scripts for the project. Then they can follow along with the instructions in the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/lizsuter/MarineAnimalDisease/wiki), while checking them off on the associated [Project Board](https://github.com/lizsuter/MarineAnimalDisease/projects/1).
