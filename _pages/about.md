Welcome to the lab of Dr. Liz Suter at [Molloy College](https://www.molloy.edu/)! I am interested in the microbial ecology of aquatic environments and the impacts that microbes have on water quality in both open ocean and coastal ecosystems. I use a mixture of classical microbiology,Â genomic, and geochemical tools to determine the roles of microbes in their natural environments, including next-generation sequencing, microscopy, and isotope probing.
