## Elemental Cycling in Oxygen-Depleted Water Columns (ODWCs)

### Cariaco Basin
<img align="right" src="/images/cariaco_logo.jpg" width="200px" style="padding-right: 15px">
ODWCs are hotspots for biogeochemical cycling by marine microbial communities. My dissertation focused on the Cariaco Basin, a permanently anoxic marine basin on the northern coast of Venezuela with a unique microbiome and intense geochemical activity. I continue to collaborate with my colleagues on this project. For more information check out the [Cariaco Ocean Time-Series](http://imars.marine.usf.edu/cariaco) and especially some of the [research](http://imars.marine.usf.edu/view/biblio/803738/year) that has come out of that project.

### MicroPro: Microbial Processes in oxygen minimum zones: From in situ community rate measurements to single cells
In summer 2020, a Molloy student and I are joining the MicroPro cruise to the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). This is an NSF-funded project to determine rates of turnover and identities of geochemically important microbes in one of the ocean's largest ODWCs. The project is led by [Dr. Maria Pachiadaki](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mpachiadaki/) at [WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/).  Check back in August 2020 for updates and a cruise blog!  
*UPDATE: Due to COVID19 this field campaign has been postponed.*

## Coastal Ecosystem Resilience

### Shellfish Microbiomes & Disease
In summer 2020, we planned to assess the health of recently restored oysters and clams by sampling their microbiomes across a pollution gradient in Great South Bay (Long Island, NY). This work has been postposed due to COVID19. Instead, Molloy research students this summer are assessing shellfish microbiomes from publicy available datasets from around the world. Check back soon for updates.

### Ecosystem Services of Restored Oyster Reefs

In summer 2018 and 2019, we sampled at Bush Terminal Park, in Brooklyn, NY. This is a site with a long history of industrial pollution, leading to contamination of the ground and surface waters. In recent years, this site has been restored into an urban park and the [Billion Oyster Project](https://www.billionoysterproject.org/) placed an oyster reef in the lagoons at the park as part of their goal to restore water quality to the Hudson Bay. We are interested in the role of microbes at this site, their interactions with heavy metals, and plastics, and the potential for microbial sewage contamination remediation.

### A Hudson River Estuary Microbial Network
<img align="right" src="/images/HRE_SYBR.png" width="250px" style="padding-right: 50px">
Sewage contamination is a consistent problem affecting many natural waterways. In the Hudson River, monitoring by Hudson Riverkeeper has shown that human gut-derived bacterial populations are frequently present at sites throughout the estuary. However, these events are not always necessarily linked to rainfall. Our [collaborators](https://juhl.ldeo.columbia.edu/) at [LDEO](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/) aim to observe and model the highly dynamic spatiotemporal variability of these populations while determining their sources and sinks in the natural environment. We are working together with them on analysis of a microbial time series from a sewage-contaminated site.
