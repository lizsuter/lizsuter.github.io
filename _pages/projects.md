### Elemental Cycling in Oxygen-Depleted Water Columns (ODWCs)


<img align="right" src="/images/cariaco_logo.jpg" width="200px" style="padding-right: 15px">

ODWCs are hotspots for biogeochemical cycling by marine microbes. My research has focused on deciphering the roles of these unique microbiomes in global biogeochemical cycling by using genomic and geochemical techniques. For more information check out the [Cariaco Ocean Time-Series project](http://imars.marine.usf.edu/cariaco).

### Microbial Communities of Restored Oyster Reefs

New York Harbor used to full of oysters, but their populations are less than 0.1% of their previous abundances. The [Billion Oyster Project](https://www.billionoysterproject.org/) builds and maintains community reefs for restoring the oyster back to NY waterways. Reefs have varying successes and failures. Some of this may be due to bacterial pathogens, which are causing disease in marine animals all over the world due to warming water temperatures. 

We are developing a bacterial health monitoring tool using third generation sequencing techniques to help restoration managers determine the onset of bacterial diseases in oyster reefs.

### A Hudson River Estuary Microbial Network

Sewage contamination is a consistent problem affecting many natural waterways. In the Hudson River, monitoring by Hudson Riverkeeper has shown that human gut-derived bacterial populations are frequently present at sites throughout the estuary. However, these events are not always necessarily linked to rainfall. My [collaborators](https://juhl.ldeo.columbia.edu/) at [LDEO](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/) aim to observe and model the highly dynamic spatiotemporal variability of these populations while determining their sources and sinks in the natural environment. We are working together on analysis of a microbial time series from a sewage-contaminated site.
