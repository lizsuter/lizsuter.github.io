## Elemental Cycling in Oxygen-Depleted Water Columns (ODWCs)

### Cariaco Basin
<img align="right" src="/images/cariaco_logo.jpg" width="200px" style="padding-right: 15px">
ODWCs are hotspots for biogeochemical cycling by marine microbial communities. My dissertation focused on the Cariaco Basin, a permanently anoxic marine basin on the northern coast of Venezuela with a unique microbiome and intense geochemical activity. I continue to collaborate with my colleagues on this project. For more information check out the [Cariaco Ocean Time-Series](http://imars.marine.usf.edu/cariaco) and especially some of the [research](http://imars.marine.usf.edu/view/biblio/803738/year) that has come out of that project.

### MicroPro: Microbial Processes in oxygen minimum zones: From in situ community rate measurements to single cells
In summer 2020, a Molloy student and I are joining the MicroPro cruise to the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). This is an NSF-funded project to determine rates of turnover and identities of geochemically important microbes in one of the ocean's largest ODWCs. The project is led by [Dr. Maria Pachiadaki](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mpachiadaki/) at [WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/).  Check back for updates and a cruise blog!  
*UPDATE: Due to COVID19 this field campaign has been postponed.*

## Coastal Ecosystem Resilience

### Ecosystem Services of Restored Oyster Reefs
<img align="left" src="/images/Summer2019.jpg" width="200px" style="padding-right: 15px">
Bush Terminal Park, in Brooklyn, NY, is an urban park with a long history of industrial pollution. In recent years, this park has been restored and is currently the location of community oyster reefs  maintained by the [Billion Oyster Project](https://www.billionoysterproject.org/). In the last several years, my students have developed projects focusing on the role of microbes at this site, their interactions with heavy metals and plastics, and the potential for microbial sewage contamination remediation.

### Shellfish Microbiomes & Disease
Recently I obtained funding to develop a bacterial health monitoring tool using third generation sequencing techniques. The project, funded by the NYS Water Resources Institute at Cornell University and the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation Hudson River Estuary Program, with support from the NYS Environmental Protection Fund, will focus on developing a user-friendly genetic monitoring tool to determine the onset of bacterial pathogens. *I am currently recruiting students for this project.*

<br/>

In summer 2020, research students from [NSURP](https://nsurp.org/) and Molloy research students from [CSTEP](http://www.nysed.gov/postsecondary-services/collegiate-science-and-technology-entry-program-cstep) worked on virtual research projects by developing pipelines to assess the incidence of pathogens in published marine invertebrate microbiomes. Check back soon for updates.

### A Hudson River Estuary Microbial Network
<img align="right" src="/images/HRE_SYBR.png" width="250px" style="padding-right: 50px">
Sewage contamination is a consistent problem affecting many natural waterways. In the Hudson River, monitoring by Hudson Riverkeeper has shown that human gut-derived bacterial populations are frequently present at sites throughout the estuary. However, these events are not always necessarily linked to rainfall. My [collaborators](https://juhl.ldeo.columbia.edu/) at [LDEO](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/) aim to observe and model the highly dynamic spatiotemporal variability of these populations while determining their sources and sinks in the natural environment. We are working together on analysis of a microbial time series from a sewage-contaminated site.
